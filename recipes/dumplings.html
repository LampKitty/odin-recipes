    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        My mother used to make a lot of dumplings, and  <br>
        I never ate something from microwave or package, <br>
        because I already knew the taste of homemade food
    </p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. <br>
            Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. <br>
            Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be <br>
            scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes..</li>
        <li>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. <br>
            Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
